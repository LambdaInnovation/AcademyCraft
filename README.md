[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LambdaInnovation/AcademyCraft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LambdaInnovation/AcademyCraft)

A Minecraft mod about superability. The inspiration of AcademyCraft comes from [A Certain Scientific Railgun (とある科学の超電磁砲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun) but the mod content is not limited of the background.

Visit [AcademyCraft's Website](https://ac.li-dev.cn/) to get the latest release and know more about it.

Issue(Idea, Bug) Submission
============

Please go to [Issues](https://github.com/LambdaInnovation/AcademyCraft/issues) and submit a new ticket.

Developement
===========

## Build

Simply use `gradlew build`. If you encounter `Unknown constant: 18` error, `gradlew build` again and it should be fine.

## Workspace

We recommend use Intellij IDEA. Eclipse is untested and unsupported.

You must have scala plugin installed.

To setup a Intellij IDEA workspace:

```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace idea
```
then you can open the `.ipr` project file and start developing.

Localization
============

Any localization help is greatly appreciated! Please submit the PR to `dev` branch. Proper
credits for the translator will be given in the next version's release. Note that contents include
[Lang files][langdir] and [Tutorial texts][tutdir].

## Modpack permission

Yes. >)

## Regarding Toaru Magic Index

Many people have been asking questions about whether or how much the mod will be related to
the original story _A Certain Magic Index_. Our answer is that although AC is based on the 
_Railgun_, which is a spinoff of _Index_, the mod will only focus on the science side of 
the story, and thus just loosely related to _Index_.

The mod is dedicated to build an interesting experience evolved around the idea of **superability**,
that's really everything.
