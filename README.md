## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of AcademyCraft!

AcademyCraft is a Minecraft mod about superability, including its aquiring, upgrading and using. The inspiration of the mod comes from [A Certain Scientific Railgun (とある科学の超電磁砲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun) but the mod content is not limited of the background.

AcademyCraft is licensed under the [GPL license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html "gpl license")
