Resources

![brief]
Four kinds of ores generate in the game world: __Constraint Metal Ore__, __Imag Crystal Ore__, __Imag Silicon Ore__ and __Resonant Crystal Ore__. Also there is an important liquid resource called __Imag Phase Liquid__, you can only collect it with Matter Unit.

![content]
Huge amount of imag energy appears in the world for some reason. Most of them is assembled and become resources in the ground. 

#Constrain Metal Ore

When the iron absorbs imag energy, it becomes Constrain Metal Ore. The Constrain Metal Ore is as hard as iron, thus you are able to collect it by Stone Pickaxe. Smelting the ore and you will get Constrain Metal Ingot, which is raw material of Constrain Metal Plate. Constrain Metal Plate has many function like making Matter Unit, transporting imag energy and extending distance limit of imag energy transport. 

#Imag Silicon Ore

Stone is reverted to silicon when they absorbs imag energy, and has purple glory because of imag energy. Imag Silicon Ore must be collect by Iron Pickaxe or better. Producing Imag Silicon Wafer and Imag Silicon Piece from this ore, then making chips.

#Imag Crystal Ore and Resonant Crystal Ore

Sometimes the stone become crystal after getting touch with imag energy, and the crystal has special molecular structure. Both Imag Crystal Ore and Resonant Crystal Ore have a mining level of Diamond. Imag Crystal could store some imag energy and Resonant Crystal is able to hold certain frequency.

Usually, we use Imag Crystal as nodes which store imag energy. However, the raw Low-purity Imag Crystal cannot store too much imag energy. Refining Imag Crystal in Imag Fusor to get higher purity Imag Crystal in order to store more imag energy.

Resonant Crystal could distinguish certain frequency and adjust imag energy output to a certain frequency, therefore it is a significant part of wireless energy system.

#Imag Phase Liquid

Water is transform to Imag Phase Liquid when absorbs small amount of imag energy. The only way to collect Imag Phase Liquid is using Matter Unit. The water is luminous because of the influence of imag energy.

There are two ways to make use of Imag Phase Liquid: producing energy in Phase Generator or reshaping items in Imag Fusor.
