Wind Generator is the symbol of Academic City for its attractive appearance. 

Wind Generator Pillar Base is main part of the generator, which is responsible for storing the Imag Energy, displaying information and support the generator. You might build lots of Wind Generator Pillar so as to reach a reasonable height. Then place Wind Generator at the top of the pillar and put Wind Generator Fan in it. Remember: taller the machine is, the more energy you will get.

Besides, the Wind Generator works only when it has enough space to render the spinning Wind Generator Fan. Roughly 7*7 blocks' space in the vertical direction is essential. Also the height must between 8 blocks and 40 blocks.
