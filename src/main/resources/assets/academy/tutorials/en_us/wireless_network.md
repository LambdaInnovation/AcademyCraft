Wireless Network

![brief]

![content]
Imag Energy, which unit is Imag Flux (IF), could be transported wirelessly. This trait is very convenient.

In our world, old wired network has been abandoned. You need to be familiar with wireless network so as to use our advanced machines.

Wireless system consists of two different structures: Channel and Network. The core of former is Node and of latter is Matrix.

# Channel

Channel is the fundamental unit of large wireless network. One Node together with subsidiary machines is a channel.

## Node

Nodes include Basic, Improved and Advanced Wireless Imag Node. 

Higher level Node could store more Imag Energy, link with more machines and cover a larger area.

You are able to change name and password of a channel in Node's panel, and press enter to confirm after modifying. The Node is called "Unnamed" with no password by default.

Note that only the owner of Node has the privilege to change name and password. 

## How to build a channel

Let's move to how to connect machines to Node.

When you open the panel of a Node, you could find two little button in the left. Click the second button with WiFi icon to open the wireless network panel. Select the Node you want to connect and enter the password if necessary, then click the white wire-like button to finish the connection. Another way to build connection is using Frequency Transmitter in Data Terminal. Opening Frequency Transmitter then follow the prompt to build connection.

The Node plays an important role in a Channel.

# Network

The Network is short for Large Wireless Energy Network, consists of Wireless Imag Matrix and Channel. The Wireless Imag Matrix is the core of Network. 

## Wireless Imag Matrix

To build a working Matrix, you need Wireless Imag Matrix itself, Matrix Core and at least three Reinforced Iron Plate. Put the core and all three plates in Matrix to boot it.

There are three kinds of Matrix Core: Basic, Improved and Advanced. Higher level core has better performance, you know. 

The performance of a Matrix is measured by Range, Capacity and Bandwidth. All of them are decided by Matrix Core.

What makes Matrix different from Node is you must initialize it (click the INIT in the panel) before you first use. 

ONLY the owner has the privilege to change name and password, of course. 

## How to build a Network

Connect Channels to the Matrix to build a Network.

Similar to machines, the Node also have a wireless icon button in the left of panel. In this panel you could connect a Node to a Matrix by the same steps as connecting a machine to a Channel. 

The Network will automatically control the flow of Imag Energy and balance the Imag Energy in each Channel. 

Attention: You could build a Channel without connect it to a Network, that is to say, the Network is not essential if you only have a few machines.
