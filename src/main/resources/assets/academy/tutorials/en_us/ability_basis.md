## Learning Skills

You can see all the skills available for you to learn in Ability Developer. Different from skills you have already learned, they are marked as grey. Your first skill 
does not need any other prerequisites, but some other skills will have certain requirements to your abilility level, class of Ability Developer and other skills' experience. 
Every time you learn something, energy will be consumed from the developer.

## Skill Experience

By continiously using skills, their experience will grow. When the experience exceed some certain value, your skill might have some certain new effects and discover new usages!

## Upgrading

Throught usage of ability, your maxium CP (Calculation Point) will grow. When the CP reaches the high threshod of current level, you can upgrade to next level. 
Your upgrade status can be revealed in Ability Developer. Upgrading will require a large amount of energy, and might require more advanced class of developer.

## Reset Ability

You need Advanced Ability Developer, High Voltage Magnetic Coil and Ability Induction Factor to reset your ability.

Put the Ability Induction Factor in your inventory, open Advanced Ability Developer with High Voltage Magnetic Coil. Then enter "reset" after loading finish.

You will get a certain ability according to the Ability Induction Factor. But remember that your ability level will reduce one level after reset ability, so you cannot reset your ability when you at level one. 

# Using Ability

## Basics

You can manage your control of skills through the __Preset System__ and change the control settings any time.

The __Key Hint Bar__ located in right lets you know current key mapping of control.

While your ability is activated, use ![key id="switch_preset"] to switch the current preset.

P.S. You can change the ability using key from __Settings App__.

## CP and Overload

Every time you use any skill, a certain amount of CP (Calculation Point) is consumed. CP measures how tired your brain is out of ability usage. 
The consuming and recovering of CP are both slow.

Also, using ability will cause dramatic workload in a short time, which is measured as __Overload__. It is displayed in the background layer 
of the CP bar. When overload exceeds the max value, You have to stop using ability until fully recover.
